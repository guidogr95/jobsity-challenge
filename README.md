# React Challenge

 - No api keys are needed for this. In order to use the weather API I had to run it on a custom server. The link to this repo is https://github.com/guidogr95/jobsity-challenge-api
 - The ammount of cities for which the forecast API works is limited and it is fetch in real-time when typing on the input.


## How to deploy

 - Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
 - Run `npm start` to run the app locally.
 - You can find the project running on `localhost:3000`.
